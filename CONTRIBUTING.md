# Contribution Guidelines

## Fixing or Updating the Glossary

Please consider the following points before proceeding:

* The purpose of this glossary is for AI/ML researchers to understand how each language community groups and refers to AI terminology, topics and the SOTA in general. The mapping should be commonly used or officially accepted as much as possible.
* When you issue a pull request, you agree that your contribution is in the public domain (guided by the [CC-BY-SA license](LICENSE)).
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion. This allows to better handle updates or comments on the proposed fix or update.

description of the change request meaningful and explain, why the change to the glossary or the update to the topic is necessary.
